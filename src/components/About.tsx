                    <p>My name is Mart√≠n Herguedas, and I am a 21-year-old student originally from Madrid, Spain. Currently, I am pursuing my university studies at Boston University, building on the foundation I gained from my education at the Liceo Italiano di Madrid. I have a deep passion for various fields, particularly technology, space exploration, photography, and Formula 1. Each of these interests has shaped my academic and personal pursuits, driving me to explore new frontiers and push the boundaries of my knowledge. Additionally, I have dedicated 8 years to practicing fencing, an experience that has greatly contributed to my development. Through fencing, I have honed my sports skills, discipline, and resilience, all of which have been instrumental in shaping my character and approach to life. These diverse experiences, combined with my academic endeavors and personal passions, have played a significant role in defining who I am today.</p>
