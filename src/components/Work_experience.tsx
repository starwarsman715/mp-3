                    <p>During my internship at SENER Aerospace, I had the incredible opportunity to work on the NAVIGA project in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). NAVIGA is an advanced project focused on developing navigation systems for the 4th stage of the Vega-C rocket. My role involved contributing to the testing of such systems, which are crucial for precise atmospheric navigation and positioning.</p>
